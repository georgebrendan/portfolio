									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Ender3dprinter.jpg" alt="Ender Pro V2" class="centerImage" /></a>
									<p>Last year during my Internship, I was exposed tremenously by my mentor on 3D printing. 
									As an intern in a Research & Development Corporate Lab, many of my projects used 3D printing considerations while designing, cheaper alternative for prototypes.<br>
									My interest spark with 3D printing, knowing the amount of designs and prototypes I could do at a cheap cost. I even bought a 3D printer by <i>Ender</i>.<br>
									With this interest, I took up workshops on Coursea to enhance my Solidwork skills and a Course on Fusion 360 which was known for they designing platform for 3D-printing.<br>
									I understood more about the 3D printing industry and what it has to offer for future developments.

									<h1>ANSYS<br>
									<i></i><br />
									</h1>
									<p> During my internship, I was given an opportunity to learn ANSYS software. <br>
										ANSYS provide a one stop full package of modelling, assembly and analysis. The software provide accurate results on specific requirements.
										I understood the basic knowledge of Finite Element Analysis (FEM) within the platform. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis would be a bonus to learn in the future.<br>
